# WattPrint

Mobile app that turns a household electricity meter into a per-device breakdown. One whole-home
sensor feeds NILM (non-intrusive load monitoring) to show which appliances cost money and when,
prices usage with Vietnam's tiered / TOU tariff, and adds an AI energy copilot that explains the
numbers and suggests low-burden behaviour experiments.

The backend is an **external FastAPI service**; this repo is the Expo client only. All HTTP goes
through `src/lib/api-client.ts` using `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
